         improves generalization accuracy on a main task by using the
         information contained in the training signals of other related
         tasks. It does this by learning the extra tasks in parallel with
         the main task while using a shared representation; what is
         learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better.
         This chapter describes a dozen opportunities for applying
         multitask learning in real problems. At the end of the chapter
         we also make several suggestions for how to get the most our
         of multitask learning on real-world problems."
